The calculator supports the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, square root, and square.

The calculator offers the following features: ability to clear the current operand (clear) and 
ability to remove the right-most digit of the current operand (backspace).

The calculator takes operands in order of input, i.e., the first number entered is the 
first operand in any operation.

The display always shows the current operand, which is in some cases the result 
of the last operation.

To see the result of any operation, press the `=` button, and the result will show in the display.
